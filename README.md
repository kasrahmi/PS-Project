# R Simulation Project

Welcome to the R Simulation Project! This repository hosts a collection of R scripts designed to simulate and visualize data for three unique scenarios. Each scenario offers insights into various phenomena through simulation and graphical representation.

## Problems

### 1. Mountain Climbing Flag Placement Simulation

Experience the thrill of scaling virtual peaks! This simulation replicates the placement of flags during mountain climbs, considering factors such as altitude, wind speed, and terrain steepness. Histograms provide a visual overview of flag placement distributions.

### 2. Online Video Streaming Simulation

Dive into the world of online video streaming! Explore how random starting points and fluctuating bandwidth speeds impact user experiences. Through simulation, we uncover insights into streaming behavior, complemented by engaging visualizations.

### 3. Potato Cooking Simulation

Become a master chef with our potato cooking simulation! Discover the perfect shake-to-cook ratio for deliciously golden potatoes. Graphs showcase the cooking process and reveal the optimal shaking frequency for culinary perfection.
